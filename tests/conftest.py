"""
This file ensures everything is in place to run PyTest based unit tests against
the adafruit_radio module. It works by using Python's mock library to add
MagicMock objects to sys.modules for the modules which are not available to
standard Python because they're CircuitPython only modules.
Such mocking happens as soon as this conftest.py file is imported (so the
mocked modules exist in sys.modules before the module to be tested is
imported), and immediately before each test function is evaluated (so changes
to state remain isolated between tests).
